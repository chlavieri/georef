# georef

This is my georeferencing repository. It's mainly coded in Python and R.


It is still a work in progress. In the future I will do some georeferencing on statistics related to Brazilian states and maybe municipalities in the state of SÃ£o Paulo (with shapefiles from the "SP" directory). Later, I will do some analysis on other countries. Suggestions are welcomed.
